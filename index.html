						<li>Service designer
						<li>Interaction designer
				</ul>
				<p>As a designer my goal is to make sure we're solving the right problem, in a way that makes users fall in love with the solution.
				It will take a hundred no's to get to the right yes, but we'll find it together.</p>

				<p>My strengths lie in service design, strategic design, and usability. I'm not as strong a graphic designer, and I shouldn't make your logo.</p>

				<h4>Concrete skills</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Designing services (both digital and analogue)
					<li>Designing digital products
					<li>Designing web pages (and making them)
					<li>User research
					<li>Mapping and visulizing findings
					<li>Wireframing, creating interaction designs
					<li>Holding workshops and facilitating
					<li>Project management and product ownership
				</ul>

				<h4>Background:</h4>
				<p>I have a 5 year Master of Design, from AHO. My <a href="#master">Master thesis</a> was on how Service designers can get projects realized.
					<p>Dad taught me the first tenets of web design in primary school. 
						Back then my hero was the usability old-timer and guru <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/author/jakob-nielsen/">Jakob Nielsen</a>.
					<p>I've been paid to do design in some form or other since 2006.</p>
					<p>I strongly believe you can only design what you understand. 
						For me, that extends beyond user research and picking the brains of stakeholders into learning everything from programming to business.</p>

				</ul>
				<p>I can make your idea into a real, usable, thing. I'm best suited for making your webpage, MVP, or prototype. </p>
				<p>I've been programming since dad taught me HTML and &lt;blink&gt; in 1998. Using web technologies I can create almost anything, but I don't have a CS degree and can't explain different sort algorithms. </p>

				<h4>Concrete skills</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Web pages and in-browser apps of all types (Using all sorts of CMSes)
					<li>Web based Mac/Windows/iOS/Android apps (Electron, React Native, etc.)
					<li>Web server based backends (Node, PHP)
					<li>Front end stuff: Deep knowledge of HTML, CSS. Good knowledge of JS, React. Have used Angular, jquery, and loads of older stuff.
					<li>Back end stuff: Node, SQL, noSQL. Learnt PHP a long time ago. 
				</ul>

				<h4>Background:</h4>
				<p>The latest and biggest thing I've built is <a href="https://receiptrunner.com">Receipt Runner</a>, an Electron based Mac,
				Windows, and Linux app that finds the receipts you need to deliver to your accountant. Making it has taught me React, Electron, and how to handle a biggish code base.</p>

				<p>I've run my own freelance business since 2008, but when we did our master thesis and <a href="https://makeitbetter.no/diploma">found that service designers lack business understanding</a> I understood that wasn't enough to make designs that actually work.
					 Since then, I've been seeking out knowledge on business from both books and experience. It's lead me to take an Executive MBA from Quantic, work as a product owner for frivillig.no, and attempt to be a founder for Receipt Runner.
					
					</p>

				<h4>Concrete skills</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Executive MBA (Quantic) and Economics (UiO). Basic understanding of market economics, leadership theory, finance theory, operations management, strategy, innovation theory, accounting, data backed decision making, statistics, pricing, and change management.
					<li>Deep dive into startups and entrepreneurship, including failed attempts at raising funds.
					<li>Experience leading teams from both non-profits and for-profits

				<p>The non-profit Frivillighet Norge hired me to create two things: </p>

				<ol>
					<li>A website for volunteers to find missions they can do for non-profits all around Norway, based on the success of Volont√§rbyr√•n in Sweden
					<li>A team to run the website and help train non-profit organizations in recruiting, welcoming and keeping the volunteers
				</ol>

				<p>We had funding based on the hope that we would recruit 500 volunteers in 2016 and grow to recruiting 3000 in 2019. We crushed those goals, and by the time I left the project we'd had over 4000 people sign up to volunteer in just 10 months.</p>

				<p><strong>I've had the honour of doing freelance work for big companies like Posten Norway and Ulstein, together with fantastic people in local service design companies like Eggs, LiveWork and Halogen.</strong></p>

				<p>Work has ranged from simple one-day helping hands to complex, months long projects, planning services on a strategic level. In different teams I've helped arrange workshops, worked with internal communication, done user and field research and created service blueprints.</p>
				<p>Many were done as a two-man team together with Jane Pernille Landa Hansen.</p>
				<p>The contents of the projects are confidential, but there's a list of clients in my <a href="#cv">CV</a> below.</p>
				<p>Here's a few non-confidential student projects:</p>


				<h3 class="wp clear" id="master">Master thesis: <br />Service Design as a Service</h3>
				<p>In the spring of 2015 <a href="https://no.linkedin.com/in/jane-pernille-landa-hansen-80791457">Jane Pernille Landa Hansen</a> and I did over 60 interviews and shadowed five processes
				to write a thesis on how Service Designers can get our designs implemented in 
				bigger organisations.</p>
				<p><a href="http://makeitbetter.no">Here is the resulting work</a>. We hope it can help you.</p>

				<h3 class="wp clear" id="teknisk">Science Museum Map</h3>
				<p><strong>Visitors found it hard to navigate the museum. After analyzing and understanding why, I came up with a new map which tests 24 times better than the old one:</strong></p>
				<img alt="The new map I made for Teknisk Museum" class="huge" src="images/tm_kart_nytt.png">
				<div class="white">
				<p><em>Teknisk Museum</em> is a success with double the visitors today it had only ten years ago. That success leads also to increased demand for tools that help you navigate the museum without having to ask the personell.</p>
				<p>In this project we worked closely with the museum and I wanted to make something the fantastic people working there could actually implement with their current budget. After the analysis I had several different angles of attack, but chose to create a new map on the evaluation that it would have the biggest impact for the museum and still be feasable.</p>
				<h4>Testing on the Turk</h4>
				<p>To test it I built a tool using Amazon Mechanical Turk where I paid people 40 cents to come in and draw directions on the map. Afterwards I had numbers showing that 24 times more people found the way on my new map - and a few hundred drawings that I combined into these telling images:</p>
					<div class="half full-image">
					<h4>The old map:</h4>
					<img alt="The old map is two dimensional, and difficult to parse" src="images/average_old.jpg">
					</div>
					<div class="half full-image">
					<h4>The new map:</h4>
					<img alt="The new map is three dimensional, and shows clearly the paths between stories" src="images/average_nytt_kart.jpg">
					</div>
				<p class="clear">You can clearly see the common mistakes like walking in the air (the white area on the old map is not walkeable) -  but also telling is the fritzyness around the areas fewer people have been to.</p>

				<p><strong>Bring wanted to win hearts. But how do you do that when you're a boring, mundane company with a service that's just supposed to work? Together with a great team and the great people at Bring we tackled that problem in this service design student project.</strong></p>
				<div class="half">
				<p>Based on user and field research into Brings customers and operations we saw a potential to win hearts when things go wrong. 
				We then researched how hearts are won and how stories are told, and used that knowledge from fields as diverse as marketing and story telling to construct new rules for Brings customer service.</p>
				<p>The concept is about giving Brings customers
				an experience that not only won their heart, but
				that is worth retelling. A story they will want
				to share with friends, colleagues and the internet.
				To be worth retelling a story needs to be
				about more than solving a problem. It needs
				emotions and unexpected twists, as well as great
				dramaturgy.</p>
				<p>We think that all you need to get a shot at this
				kind of great story is a person in distress who
				contacts you, and a service that is designed to
				handle that situation with grace.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bighalf full-image">
					<img src="images/license-to-help.png">
				</div>
				<p class="clear">The idea is not to change every customer
				interaction into an adventure, but to create
				a system which works for the mundane and
				is ready to seize the opportunity when the
				extraordinary is possible. The way we do this
				is by giving Bring employees the mandate and
				resources they need to create great stories for
				their customers. In essence, we give them a
				license to help.</p>


				<p class="clear">The end result is a Bring that wins hearts and
				creates stories that lives on and market the
				brand both internally and externally, effectively
				creating good company morale, happier
				workers, a stronger brand identity and lifelong
				loyalty from customers.</p>
